# CRISPR Spacer Database

CRISPR-Cas adaptive immune systems are a unique form of adaptive immunity found in prokaryotes wherein viral DNA or RNA sequences are stored on the host genome in the form of short (~30bp) "spacers". These spacers, stored at a repetitive CRISPR "array" can be used to reliably associate viruses with their hosts.

# CRISPR Spacer Database

CRISPR-Cas adaptive immune systems are a unique form of [adaptive immunity](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/315/5819/1709) found in prokaryotes wherein [viral DNA or RNA sequences are stored on the host genome in the form of short (~30bp) "spacers"](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00239-004-0046-3). [These spacers, stored at a repetitive CRISPR "array" can be used to reliably associate viruses with their hosts](https://academic.oup.com/femsre/article/40/2/258/2570202). This approach, though precise, will inevitably miss host-virus pairs where the host lacks a CRISPR array ( [a majority of bacteria](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrmicro3569), [especially certain groups](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms10613?origin=ppub)), or where the diversity of host CRISPR spacers has been inadequately profiled. Nevetheless, this method [can give highly confident host-virus pairs when a perfect match is found](https://academic.oup.com/femsre/article/40/2/258/2570202).

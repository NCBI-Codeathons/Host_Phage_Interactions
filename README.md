## Intro statement

Viruses that infect microbes (both Bacteria and Archaea), commonly known as phage, have a direct impact on the organisms present in all microbiomes, regardless of environment. Like the microbiome, phage present in a sample can be diagnostic of the conditions (e.g., microbial community structure, underlying physiochemical conditions, etc.), but unlike the microbial hosts have smaller genomes that may more easily assemble in a metagenomic sample. Indexing metagenomic samples on the viral community will provide a way categorize metagenomic samples in NCBI SRA that will allow for the identification of related sample types.

## What's the problem?

The Host Phage Interaction (HPI) group developed three tracks and databases to explore the nature host-phage interactions, specifically:

 - Known Host-Phage Interactions Database, detailing the current known linkages of infection, collected from NCBI
 - CRISPR Spacer Database, constructed by extracting spacer information from CRISPR arrays representing a large breadth of microorganisms 
 - E. coli Prophage Virulence Factor Database, a collection of clinical and environmental E. coli screened for prophage sequences and corresponding bacterial virulence factors

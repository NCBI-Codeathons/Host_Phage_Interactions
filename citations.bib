               replicated as part of, the host bacterial genome. These mobile
               elements can have tremendous impact on their bacterial hosts'
               genomes and phenotypes, which may lead to strain emergence and
               diversification, increased virulence or antibiotic resistance.
               However, finding prophages in microbial genomes remains a
               problem with no definitive solution. The majority of existing
               tools rely on detecting genomic regions enriched in
               protein-coding genes with known phage homologs, which hinders
               the de novo discovery of phage regions. In this study, a
               weighted phage detection algorithm, PhiSpy was developed based
               on seven distinctive characteristics of prophages, i.e. protein
               length, transcription strand directionality, customized AT and
               GC skew, the abundance of unique phage words, phage insertion
               points and the similarity of phage proteins. The first five
               characteristics are capable of identifying prophages without any
               sequence similarity with known phage genes. PhiSpy locates
               prophages by ranking genomic regions enriched in distinctive
               phage traits, which leads to the successful prediction of 94\%
               of prophages in 50 complete bacterial genomes with a 6\%

              Zika virus and Ebola virus are examples of viral zoonosis, which
              occur more frequently due to globalization. In case of a virus
              outbreak, it is helpful to know which host organism was the
              original carrier of the virus. Once the reservoir or intermediate
              host is known, it can be isolated to prevent further spreading of
              the viral infection. Recent approaches aim to predict a viral
              host based on the viral genome, often in combination with the
              potential host genome and using arbitrary selected features. This
              methods have a clear limitation in either the amount of different
              hosts they can predict or the accuracy of the prediction. Here,
              we present a fast and accurate deep learning approach for viral
              host prediction, which is based on the viral genome sequence
              only. To assure a high prediction accuracy we developed an
              effective selection approach for the training data, to avoid
              biases due to a highly unbalanced number of known sequences per
              virus-host combinations.We tested our deep neural network on
              three different virus species (influenza A virus, rabies

              allowing highly accurate predictions while only using fractions
              of the viral genome sequences. We show that deep neural networks

              sequences called repeats, inter-spaced by stretches of variable
              length sequences called spacers. This CRISPR array is transcribed
              and processed into multiple mature RNA species (crRNAs). A single
              crRNA is integrated into an interference complex, together with
              CRISPR-associated (Cas) proteins, to bind and degrade invading
              nucleic acids. Although existing bioinformatics tools can
              recognize CRISPR loci by their characteristic repeat-spacer
              architecture, they generally output CRISPR arrays of ambiguous
              orientation and thus do not determine the strand from which
              crRNAs are processed. Knowledge of the correct orientation is

              The program executes rapidly, completing a 5 Mb genome in around

              around the world threaten the efficacy of currently-used medical
              treatments and call for novel, innovative approaches to manage
              multi-drug resistant infections. Phage therapy, i.e., the use of
              viruses (phages) to specifically infect and kill bacteria during
              their life cycle, is one of the most promising alternatives to
              antibiotics. It is based on the correct matching between a target
              pathogenic bacteria and the therapeutic phage. Nevertheless,
              correctly matching them is a major challenge. Currently, there is
              no systematic method to efficiently predict whether
              phage-bacterium interactions exist and these pairs must be
              empirically tested in laboratory. Herein, we present our approach
              for developing a computational model able to predict whether a
              given phage-bacterium pair can interact based on their genome.
              RESULTS: Based on public data from GenBank and phagesDB.org, we
              collected more than a thousand positive phage-bacterium
              interactions with their complete genomes. In addition, we
              generated putative negative (i.e., non-interacting) pairs. We
              extracted, from the collected genomes, a set of informative
              features based on the distribution of predictive protein-protein
              interactions and on their primary structure (e.g. amino-acid
              frequency, molecular weight and chemical composition of each
              protein). With these features, we generated multiple candidate
              datasets to train our algorithms. On this base, we built
              predictive models exhibiting predictive performance of around
              90\% in terms of F1-score, sensitivity, specificity, and
              accuracy, obtained on the test set with 10-fold cross-validation.

               Phage-therapy, i.e., the use of viruses (phages) that
               specifically infect and kill bacteria during their life cycle,
               is a re-emerging and promising alternative to solve this
               problem. The success of phage therapy mainly relies on the exact
               matching between the target pathogenic bacteria and the
               therapeutic phage. Currently, there are only a few tools or
               methodologies that efficiently predict phage-bacteria
               interactions suitable for the phage therapy, and the pairs
               phage-bacterium are thus empirically tested in laboratory. In
               this paper we present an original methodology, based on an
               ensemble-learning approach, to predict whether or not a given
               pair of phage-bacteria would interact. Using publicly available

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Identifying viral sequences in mixed metagenomes
              containing both viral and host contigs is a critical first step
              in analyzing the viral component of samples. Current tools for
              distinguishing prokaryotic virus and host contigs primarily use
              gene-based similarity approaches. Such approaches can
              significantly limit results especially for short contigs that
              have few predicted proteins or lack proteins with similarity to
              previously known viruses. METHODS: We have developed VirFinder,
              the first k-mer frequency based, machine learning method for
              virus contig identification that entirely avoids gene-based
              similarity searches. VirFinder instead identifies viral sequences
              based on our empirical observation that viruses and hosts have
              discernibly different k-mer signatures. VirFinder's performance
              in correctly identifying viral sequences was tested by training
              its machine learning model on sequences from host and viral
              genomes sequenced before 1 January 2014 and evaluating on
              sequences obtained after 1 January 2014. RESULTS: VirFinder had
              significantly better rates of identifying true viral contigs
              (true positive rates (TPRs)) than VirSorter, the current
              state-of-the-art gene-based virus classification tool, when
              evaluated with either contigs subsampled from complete genomes or
              assembled from a simulated human gut metagenome. For example, for
              contigs subsampled from complete genomes, VirFinder had 78-,
              2.4-, and 1.8-fold higher TPRs than VirSorter for 1, 3, and 5 kb
              contigs, respectively, at the same false positive rates as
              VirSorter (0, 0.003, and 0.006, respectively), thus VirFinder
              works considerably better for small contigs than VirSorter.
              VirFinder furthermore identified several recently sequenced virus
              genomes (after 1 January 2014) that VirSorter did not and that
              have no nucleotide similarity to previously sequenced viruses,
              demonstrating VirFinder's potential advantage in identifying
              novel viral sequences. Application of VirFinder to a set of human
              gut metagenomes from healthy and liver cirrhosis patients reveals
              higher viral diversity in healthy individuals than cirrhosis
              patients. We also identified contig bins containing
              crAssphage-like contigs with higher abundance in healthy patients
              and a putative Veillonella genus prophage associated with
              cirrhosis patients. CONCLUSIONS: This innovative k-mer based tool
              complements gene-based approaches and will significantly improve
              prokaryotic viral sequence identification, especially for
              metagenomic-based studies of viral ecology.",

  abstract = "Viruses of microbes impact all ecosystems where microbes drive
              key energy and substrate transformations including the oceans,
              humans and industrial fermenters. However, despite this
              recognized importance, our understanding of viral diversity and
              impacts remains limited by too few model systems and reference
              genomes. One way to fill these gaps in our knowledge of viral
              diversity is through the detection of viral signal in microbial
              genomic data. While multiple approaches have been developed and
              applied for the detection of prophages (viral genomes integrated
              in a microbial genome), new types of microbial genomic data are
              emerging that are more fragmented and larger scale, such as
              Single-cell Amplified Genomes (SAGs) of uncultivated organisms or
              genomic fragments assembled from metagenomic sequencing. Here, we
              present VirSorter, a tool designed to detect viral signal in
              these different types of microbial sequence data in both a
              reference-dependent and reference-independent manner, leveraging
              probabilistic models and extensive virome data to maximize
              detection of novel viruses. Performance testing shows that
              VirSorter's prophage prediction capability compares to that of
              available prophage predictors for complete genomes, but is
              superior in predicting viral sequences outside of a host genome
              (i.e., from extrachromosomal prophages, lytic infections, or
              partially assembled prophages). Furthermore, VirSorter
              outperforms existing tools for fragmented genomic and metagenomic
              datasets, and can identify viral signal in assembled sequence
              (contigs) as short as 3kb, while providing near-perfect
              identification (>95\% Recall and 100\% Precision) on contigs of
              at least 10kb. Because VirSorter scales to large datasets, it can
              also be used in ``reverse'' to more confidently identify viral
              sequence in viral metagenomes by sorting away cellular DNA
              whether derived from gene transfer agents, generalized
              transduction or contamination. Finally, VirSorter is made
              available through the iPlant Cyberinfrastructure that provides a
              web-based user interface interconnected with the required
              computing resources. VirSorter thus complements existing prophage
              prediction softwares to better leverage fragmented, SAG and
              metagenomic datasets in a way that will scale to modern
              sequencing. Given these features, VirSorter should enable the
              discovery of new viruses in microbial datasets, and further our
              understanding of uncultivated viral communities across diverse
              ecosystems.",

  abstract = "ABSTRACT Despite its clinical importance, detection of highly
              divergent or yet unknown viruses is a major challenge. When human
              samples are sequenced, conventional alignments classify many
              assembled contigs as ``unknown'' since many of the sequences are
              not similar to known genomes. In this work, we developed
              ViraMiner, a deep learning-based method to identify viruses in
              various human biospecimens. ViraMiner contains two branches of
              Convolutional Neural Networks designed to detect both patterns
              and pattern-frequencies on raw metagenomics contigs. The training
              dataset included sequences obtained from 19 metagenomic
              experiments which were analyzed and labeled by BLAST. The model
              achieves significantly improved accuracy compared to other
              machine learning methods for viral genome classification. Using
              300 bp contigs ViraMiner achieves 0.923 area under the ROC curve.
              To our knowledge, this is the first machine learning methodology
              that can detect the presence of viral sequences among raw
              metagenomic contigs from diverse human samples. We suggest that
              the proposed model captures different types of information of
              genome composition, and can be used as a recommendation system to
              further investigate sequences labeled as ``unknown'' by
              conventional alignment methods. Exploring these highly-divergent

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: The study of virus-host infectious association is
              important for understanding the functions and dynamics of
              microbial communities. Both cellular and fractionated viral
              metagenomic data generate a large number of viral contigs with
              missing host information. Although relative simple methods based
              on the similarity between the word frequency vectors of viruses
              and bacterial hosts have been developed to study virus-host
              associations, the problem is significantly understudied. We
              hypothesize that machine learning methods based on word
              frequencies can be efficiently used to study virus-host
              infectious associations. METHODS: We investigate four different
              representations of word frequencies of viral sequences including
              the relative word frequency and three normalized word frequencies
              by subtracting the number of expected from the observed word
              counts. We also study five machine learning methods including
              logistic regression, support vector machine, random forest,
              Gaussian naive Bayes and Bernoulli naive Bayes for separating
              infectious from non-infectious viruses for nine bacterial host
              genera with at least 45 infecting viruses. Area under the
              receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) is used to compare
              the performance of different machine learning method and feature
              combinations. We then evaluate the performance of the best method
              for the identification of the hosts of contigs in metagenomic
              studies. We also develop a maximum likelihood method to estimate
              the fraction of true infectious viruses for a given host in viral
              tagging experiments. RESULTS: Based on nine bacterial host genera
              with at least 45 infectious viruses, we show that random forest
              together with the relative word frequency vector performs the
              best in identifying viruses infecting particular hosts. For all
              the nine host genera, the AUC is over 0.85 and for five of them,
              the AUC is higher than 0.98 when the word size is 6 indicating
              the high accuracy of using machine learning approaches for
              identifying viruses infecting particular hosts. We also show that
              our method can predict the hosts of viral contigs of length at
              least 1kbps in metagenomic studies with high accuracy. The random
              forest together with word frequency vector outperforms current
              available methods based on Manhattan and [Formula: see text]
              dissimilarity measures. Based on word frequencies, we estimate
              that about 95\% of the identified T4-like viruses in viral
              tagging experiment infect Synechococcus, while only about 29\% of
              the identified non-T4-like viruses and 30\% of the contigs in the
              study potentially infect Synechococcus. CONCLUSIONS: The random
              forest machine learning method together with the relative word
              frequencies as features of viruses can be used to predict viruses
              and viral contigs for specific bacterial hosts. The maximum
              likelihood approach can be used to estimate the fraction of true
              infectious associated viruses in viral tagging experiments.",

              specifically, software optimizations have made the backend of
              PHASTER 2.7X faster than PHAST, while the addition of 80 CPUs to
              the PHASTER compute cluster are responsible for the remaining
              speed-up. PHASTER can now process a typical bacterial genome in 3
              min from the raw sequence alone, or in 1.5 min when given a
              pre-annotated GenBank file. A number of other optimizations have
              also been implemented, including automated algorithms to reduce
              the size and redundancy of PHASTER's databases, improvements in
              handling multiple (metagenomic) queries and higher user traffic,
              along with the ability to perform automated look-ups against 14
              000 previously PHAST/PHASTER annotated bacterial genomes (which
              can lead to complete phage annotations in seconds as opposed to
              minutes). PHASTER's web interface has also been entirely
              rewritten. A new graphical genome browser has been added,
              gene/genome visualization tools have been improved, and the
              graphical interface is now more modern, robust and user-friendly.

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Metagenomics, based on culture-independent
              sequencing, is a well-fitted approach to provide insights into
              the composition, structure and dynamics of environmental viral
              communities. Following recent advances in sequencing
              technologies, new challenges arise for existing bioinformatic
              tools dedicated to viral metagenome (i.e. virome) analysis as (i)
              the number of viromes is rapidly growing and (ii) large genomic
              fragments can now be obtained by assembling the huge amount of
              sequence data generated for each metagenome. RESULTS: To face
              these challenges, a new version of Metavir was developed. First,
              all Metavir tools have been adapted to support comparative
              analysis of viromes in order to improve the analysis of multiple
              datasets. In addition to the sequence comparison previously
              provided, viromes can now be compared through their k-mer
              frequencies, their taxonomic compositions, recruitment plots and
              phylogenetic trees containing sequences from different datasets.
              Second, a new section has been specifically designed to handle
              assembled viromes made of thousands of large genomic fragments
              (i.e. contigs). This section includes an annotation pipeline for
              uploaded viral contigs (gene prediction, similarity search
              against reference viral genomes and protein domains) and an
              extensive comparison between contigs and reference genomes.
              Contigs and their annotations can be explored on the website
              through specifically developed dynamic genomic maps and
              interactive networks. CONCLUSIONS: The new features of Metavir 2
              allow users to explore and analyze viromes composed of raw reads
              or assembled fragments through a set of adapted tools and a
              user-friendly interface.",

              To this end, we have adapted the viral tagging approach, which
              bypasses the need for culture-based methods to identify

              to understand virus-host interactions in complex communities. We
              have developed a method called viral tagging (VT), which combines
              mixtures of host cells and fluorescent viruses with flow
              cytometry. We investigated multiple viruses which infect each of
              two model marine bacteria that represent the slow-growing,
              photoautotrophic genus Synechococcus (Cyanobacteria) and the
              fast-growing, heterotrophic genus Pseudoalteromonas
              (Gammaproteobacteria). Overall, viral tagging results for viral
              infection were consistent with plaque and liquid infection assays
              for cyanobacterial myo-, podo- and siphoviruses and some (myo-
              and podoviruses) but not all (four siphoviruses) heterotrophic
              bacterial viruses. Virus-tagged Pseudoalteromonas organisms were
              proportional to the added viruses under varied infection
              conditions (virus-bacterium ratios), while no more than 50\% of
              the Synechococcus organisms were virus tagged even at viral
              abundances that exceeded (5 to 10$\times$) that of their hosts.
              Further, we found that host growth phase minimally impacts the
              fraction of virus-tagged Synechococcus organisms while greatly
              affecting phage adsorption to Pseudoalteromonas. Together these
              findings suggest that at least two contrasting viral life
              strategies exist in the oceans and that they likely reflect
              adaptation to their host microbes. Looking forward to the point
              at which the virus-tagging signature is well understood (e.g.,
              for Synechococcus), application to natural communities should
              begin to provide population genomic data at the proper scale for
              predictively modeling two of the most abundant biological
              entities on Earth. Viral study suffers from an inability to link
              viruses to hosts en masse, and yet delineating ``who infects

              siphoviruses) were investigated to validate the method. These
              lab-based experiments indicate that for most virus-host pairings,
              VT (viral tagging) adsorption is equivalent to traditional
              infection by liquid and plaque assays, with the exceptions being
              confined to promiscuous adsorption by Pseudoalteromonas
              siphoviruses. These experiments also reveal variability in life
              strategies across these oceanic virus-host systems with respect
              to infection conditions and host growth status, which highlights
              the need for further model system characterization to break open
              this virus-host interaction ``black box.''",

  abstract = "Abstract Summary Phigaro is a standalone command-line application
              that is able to detect prophage regions taking raw genome and
              metagenome assemblies as an input. It also produces dynamic
              annotated ``prophage genome maps'' and marks possible transposon
              insertion spots inside prophages. It provides putative taxonomic
              annotations that can distinguish tailed from non-tailed phages.
              It is applicable for mining prophage regions from large
              metagenomic datasets.Availability Source code for Phigaro is
              freely available for download at
              https://github.com/bobeobibo/phigaro along with test data. The
              code is written in Python.",
